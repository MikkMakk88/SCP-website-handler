# SCP-website-handler

Simple GUI webcrawler for retrieving and storing data about SCPs from the SCP wiki (http://www.scpwiki.com/).
The program allows the user to keep track of their favorite SCPs and helps them to be exposed to new ones.
The project was made with the goal of learning respectful webcrawling and database management, while still being useful to me.

This project is purely for my own educational purpose.
I do not endorse the use of it as it will put a load on the wiki.
