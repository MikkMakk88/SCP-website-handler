DONE  --  Make it possible to open a random SCP from the wiki

DONE  --  keep track of what SCP's I have read / don't want to read



try to limit the amount of requests I send to the wiki, use memoization.

add options for the update_all_scps function to be able to only update certain scps

add logging information

maybe save the SCP info as JSON data?
